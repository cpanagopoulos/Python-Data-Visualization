# PyViz - Data Visualization

## Background

This assignment was a real world scenario in which a real estate team wanted to trial their initial offering with investment opportunities for the San Francisco market. We were provided historical housing market data for San Francisco and tasked with both analyzing and visualizing the results. It was our first homework to test our skills using the python data visualizations libraries including plotly, matplotlib, and hvplot.
